# On/Office

It is not easy to find a quiet place where you can just work. Distractions are found anywhere, from co-workers passing by all day to your mobile device constantly keeping you up to date with the latest news.

On/Office was created to give you a private setting. Making use of powerful Virtual Reality and Web technologies, this application offers you a customisable, virtual room where the screen from your computer is streamed in front of you. Fetch a comfy seat, wear your headset and get ready to work distraction-free.

## Features

🏢 Carry a virtual office with you anywhere.
🌍 Change your environment to anything you'd like with a Panoramic image.
🔗 Powered by web technology. Runs on any headset supporting WebVR.
🖱️ A handy virtual cursor to keep your mouse position on the virtual screen updated at all times
💻 Available for Windows, Mac and Linux.
😎 Fully open-source. Read the [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) file for more background on how the code is structured and how you can get involved.

## Roadmap

* Provide separate instructions per supported headset
* Improve screen resolution
* Support for multiple screens
* Move screens using a controller
* Add support for environments built in AFrame
* Replace home-brewed WebRTC solution with an existing framework/library.
