# On/Office

On/Office was created to give you some distraction-free privacy during your work. Making use of powerful Virtual Reality and Web technologies, this application offers you a customisable, virtual room where the screen from your computer is streamed in front of you. Fetch a comfy seat, wear your headset and get ready to work distraction-free.

## Features

🌍 Change your environment to anything you'd like with a Panoramic image.

🔗 Powered by web technology. Runs on any headset supporting WebVR.

🖱️ A handy virtual cursor to keep your mouse position on the virtual screen synced at all times

💻 Available for Windows and Mac. Linux version pending.

😎 Fully open-source. Read the [DEVELOPMENT.md](./DEVELOPMENT.md) file for more background on how the code is structured and how you can get involved.
